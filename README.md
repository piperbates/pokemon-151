# Pokemon 151 game

Heavily based off the sporcle game but with no ads and hopefully a smoother experience.  

To run locally do `npm start`, pretty straight forward really.

To do
* Refactor pokemon-list-slice so it automatically slices depending on what number is added
* BUG: If end game on empty gameList the game doesn't "lose"

Future ideas:
* Share mode so you can share your score online
* Leaderboard with best complete times
* Include future generations
