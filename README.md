# Pokemon 151 game

Note: This is currently being slightly refactored to be nicer to read, and adding in typescript.  

Heavily based off the sporcle game but with no ads and hopefully a smoother experience.  

To run locally do `npm start`, pretty straight forward really.

To do
* Nicer styling, it's a bit boring at the moment
* BUG: If end game on empty gameList the game doesn't "lose"

Future plans:
* Share mode so you can share your score online
* Leaderboard with best complete times
* Include future generations
