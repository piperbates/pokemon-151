# Pokemon 151 game

Heavily based off the sporcle game but with no ads and hopefully a smoother experience.  

To do
1. Spelling and Dex number check, are the pokemon in the right dex numbers and spelt correctly?
3. Refactor pokemon-list-slice so it automatically slices depending on what number is added
4. Test countdown
5. BUG: If end game on empty gameList the game doesn't "lose"

Future ideas:
1. Share mode so you can share your score online
2. Leaderboard with best complete times
